# deardiary

I've started this project by creating some mockups with figma. I was inspired by my diary app and I thought I can develop this on my own.
This is probably the best mockup I've ever created. WIP.

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 13.2.0.

Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
